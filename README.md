# Playground and Cheatsheet for Learning C++

It is a **playground** because you may change or add the code to see how it works. 
Altogether it might make your learning process to be more interactive and it might help you to keep code quality pretty high from very beginning.

It is a **cheatsheet** because you may get back to these code examples once you want to recap the syntax of C++.

# Prerequisites

**Installing C++**

Make sure that you have [Cpp installed](https://www.syahravi.my.id/cpp/) on your machine.

**In Linux** you may check your `g++` version by running:

```sh
g++ --version
```
